All,

Congratulations on completing Analysis of Algorithms!

Due to the too-short break, there are no lectures to watch this week.

After the break, on 
  Wednesday, March 16 at 11:59AM
we will post a "Review Problem Set" that will be due on
  Thursday, March 17 at 11:59PM
The purpose of this assessment is to check and cement your understanding 
of basic concepts and to prepare for the second half of the semester.

There will be one question per lecture, similar to inclass exam questions
but adjusted to take into account that you have much more time. You can
find much more information and examples in AAReview.pdf.

Beyond the easier problems and the short time span, the only other change 
in the rules is that you must work alone.

Having personally graded all of your problems so far, I think that all
of you have a good grasp of the concepts and should do well.
