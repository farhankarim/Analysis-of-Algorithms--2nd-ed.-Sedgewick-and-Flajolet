Welcome to Week 5 of Analysis of Algorithms. The lectures for this
week address two familiar and fundamental combinatorial structures and
the use of analytic combinatorics to study them, including coverage of
several applications.

---------- 
Lecture 6: Trees. The quintessential recursive structure, trees of
various sorts are ubiquitous in scientific enquiry, and they arise
explicitly in countless computing applications. You can find broad
coverage in the textbook, but the lecture focuses on the use of
analytic combinatorics to enumerate various types of trees and study
parameters

Lecture 7: Permutations. The study of sorting algorithms is the study
of properties of permutations. We introduce analytic-combinatoric
approaches to studying permutations in the context of this
relationship.
---------- 

Your assignment for this week, due at 11:59PM on 
    Thursday, February 24, 2022
is to write up and submit solutions to 
    Exercises 6.6, 5.16, 7.26, and 7.29 
in "Analysis of Algorithms" (second edition). For the first two
problems, use analytic combinatorics to derive ~-approximations, which
considerably simplifies the calculations. A problem similar to 5.16 is
worked out in Chapter 5 on the booksite.

Also, as usual, submit a potential exam question on the week's material.
