Welcome to Week 4 of Analysis of Algorithms. The lecture for this week
introduces a completely different approach to studying properties of
discrete structures.

---------- 
Lecture 5: Analytic Combinatorics. With a basic knowledge of
recurrences, generating functions, and asymptotics, you are ready to
learn and appreciate the basic features of analytic combinatorics, a
systematic approach that avoids much of the detail of the classical
methods that we have been considering. We introduce unlabelled and
labelled combinatorial classes and motivate our basic approach to
studying them, with numerous examples.
---------- 

Your assignment for this week, due at 11:59PM on 
    Thursday, February 17, 2022
is to write up and submit solutions to 
    Exercises 5.1, 5.3, 5.7, and 5.23 
in "Analysis of Algorithms" (second edition).

For 5.1 and 5.23, ~-approximations suffice. Be  sure to note
the errata listed on the booksite. Specifically, \rho^n should be
\rho^{-n} in the Corollary on page 250 (and on slide 46 in lecture 5).

For 5.23, you can apply the Corollary to Theorem 5.5 even though the
radius of convergence is not >1. The theorem holds because the partial
sums of the coefficients converge to f(1), which is a sufficient condition
as noted in the last line of the proof of the theorem. (If you want to
prove that fact for this case, you can do so for extra credit.)

As usual, you also need to submit a potential inclass exam question on the
week's material.
